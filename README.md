bpm2ms
======
Stupid simple java program that calculates the milisecond values of rhythms (1/4 notes, 1/8th notes, etc.) based on whatever BPM you input.
If you need to program a reverb pre delay, a delay time, or some other tempo-based effect this is what you want.  


Nothing special, probably never gonna update it. gl;hf
